# My VSCode Setup

This repository documents my customized Visual Studio Code setup with enhanced usability and UI tweaks.

---

## Key Features

- Custom **leader key mappings** (`space` as leader) for common commands:
  - `space + f`: Quick file search in project (centered UI, Must be outside the editor to use this)
- Minimal, clean UI with:
  - Hidden default status bar except showing current Vim mode at top-right
  - Centered Quick Open palette for file search
  - Custom colors and fonts (`Dank Mono`, Dracula Spirit theme)
  - Block-style cursor and blinking enabled for a Neovim feel
- Editor configured for smooth coding:
  - Relative line numbers
  - Large line height for readability
  - Disabled unnecessary UI elements (minimap, breadcrumbs, lightbulb, etc.)
 

Gonna be adding more keybinds/configurations soon : )
